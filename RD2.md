The objective of lab 04 was to practice with string methods and formating, decision making, input validation with loops, write your own algorithm, flowchart and control paths before coding. 

The procedure went smoothly as we met up and we were together for the most part. Firstly, I met up with Jordi to make a game plan and figure out what to do. Jordi made the test cases, and I wrote the main code in PyCharm. Jordi and I wrote the algorithm so I could follow that to write the code. Jordi made the test cases for the Github with the three of them. We were a group of four so we couldn’t go into the same GitHub as the maximum capacity was three so me and Jordi both made a code which is basically the same so that we could hand it in on GitHub for the full group. A technique we used was thinking aloud and group force. The Key Concepts we explored were teamwork and designing algorithms.  We explored these by working together and figuring out how to make the code look nice and clear so that every non-coder could also understand our code. 
	The results did match my expectations. They even exceeded my expectations a bit. It went a lot better than my first lab so I’m happy to see the progress we made, and I think the group I worked with to make this was very helpful. We tried using various test cases as well as extreme test cases. The code worked for every test case we used.
