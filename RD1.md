The main objective of this lab was to continuing practice writing code that incorporates, multiple inputs from the user, math, and being able to print the desired output that the user wanted. 
Also, I continued practicing writing algorithms and performing test cases while using Excel and its function to compute immediate data that I needed for the code. 
Our code was based on the algorithm that was written in order to solve the problem that the user had asked us to complete. 
I used Excel functions in order to make sure that my program works currently. 
In addition, the concepts that we continue to explore was using math within our code to help the desired user complete some calculations, in this case, it was to calculate the cost of the user's subscription package. 
We were able to get the results desired from the user. 
Also, we used various test cases to ensure that the program ran smoothly. 
The main challenge we ran into was just making sure that we were inputting the correct formulas into the code, so that the user can get its desired results from the program we created. 
We ensured that we followed the 3 rules of programming by first listing the problem from the user, how we plan to solve, and then created an algorithm, so that we could create the userâ€™s desired program. 
In addition, I feel like I learned a deeper knowledge of how to use conditions and to make sure they are true for the output I need them. 
I enjoyed working with Megan, we had great chemistry which allowed for us to work together really well and complete this assignment smoothly.
